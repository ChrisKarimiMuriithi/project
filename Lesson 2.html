	<h3>1. By whom and when were both the heavens and the earth made ?</h3>
	<p><q>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth</q><span class="verse">Genesis 1:1</span></p>
	<h3>2. For what purpose did God make heaven and the earth ?</h3>
	<p><q>For thus saith the Lord,that created the heavens:God Himself that formed the earth and made it;He hath established it,He created it not in vain:He formed it to be inhabited</q><span class="verse">Isaiah </span></p>
	<h3>3. What do the scripture state that the heaven declare ?</h3>
	<p><q>The heavens declare the glory of God;and the firmament sheweth His handiwork
	</q><span class="verse">Psalm 19:1</span></p>
	<h3>4. To whom is worship and adoration at all times due ?</h3>
	<p><q>O come,let us worship and bow down:let us knell before the Lord our maker</q><span class="verse">Plasm 95:6</span></p>
	<h3>5. What will become of the graven images and false gods of the heathen ?</h3>
	<p><q>Thus shall ye say unto them,the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth,even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens,</q><span class="verse">Jeremiah 10:11</span></p>
	<h3>6. How does God contrast His own power with that of false gods,and in what way does He inform us to distinguish between them ?</h3>
	<p><q>Let them bring them forth,and shew us what shall happen:let them shew the former things what they be,that we may consider them:and know the latter end of them, or declare us things for to come.Shew the things that are to come hereafter,that we may know that ye are gods</q><span class="verse">Isaiah 41:22,23</span></p>
	<h3>7. Who created Man,and whose likeness is he ?</h3>

	<h3>8. The character and power of Man is just little inferior to what great class of God's creatures ?</h3>

	<h3>9. What home did God first give Man after his creation ?</h3>
	<p><q>And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden,and there He put the Man He had formed</q><span class="verse">Genesis 2:8</span></p>
	<h3>10. What did the Lord provide for food for this Man,and what did He give him to do ?</h3>
	<p><q>And out of the ground made the Lord to grow every tree that is peasant to the sight,and good for food...And the Lord God took the Man,put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it </q><span class="verse">Genesis 2:9,15</span></p>
	<h3>11. What great lesson may we learn through the things that are made ?</h3>
	<p><q>For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen,being understood by the things that are made:even His eternal power and Godhead:so that they are without excuse</q><span class="verse">Romans 1:20</span></p>
	<h3>12. In view of the curse upon this earth by reason of disobedience and sin,what hath our creator promised ?</h3>
	<p><q>For,behold,I create new heavens and a nwe earth:and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind</q><span class="verse">Isaiah 65:17</span></p>
	<pre>
		All praise to Thee,eternal lord,
		Clothed in a garb of flesh and blood;
		Choosing a manger for Thy throne,
		While worlds on worlds are Thine alone!

		One did the skies before Thee bow;
		A virgin's arms contain Thee now:
		Angels,who did Thee rejoice,
		Now listen to Thine infant voice.

		A little child,Thou art our guest,
		That weary ones in Thee may rest;
		Forlorn and lowly is Thy birth,
		That we may rise up from this earth.

		Thou comest in the darksome night 
		To make us children of the light;
		To make us,in the realms divine,
		Like Thine own angels round Thee shine.

		All this for us Thy love hath done;
		By this to Thee our life is won;
		For this we tune our cheerful lays,
		And tell our thanks in songs of praise.
