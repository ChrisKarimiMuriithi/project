	O that the Lord would guide my ways 
	O that my God would grant me grace 
	To know and do His will!

	Order my footsteps by Thy word,
	And make my heart sincere;
	Let sin have no dominion,Lord,
	But keep my conscience clear.

	Make me to walk in Thy command 
	Tis a delightful road;
	Nor let my head,nor heart,nor hands
	Offend against my God
