<h1>Searching the scriptures.</h1>
<h3>1. What did Messiah command the People of His day concerning the Scriptures ?</h3>
<p><q>Search the scriptures;for in them ye think ye have eternal life;and they are they which testify of Me</q><span class="verse">John 5:39</span></p>
<p class="Note">NOTE:When this was spoken not a word of the New Testament had been written.It was to the Old Testament that the Jew looked as their guide to eternal life,and although they would not accept Messiah,He said that these very books,which they esteemed so highly testified of Him.If the Old Testament points to Messiah,it is worthy of our careful study.</p>
<h3>2. How early early have we any record that the gospsel was preached ? </h3>
<p><q>And the Scropture,foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith,preached before the gospel unto Abraham</q><span class="verse">Galatians 3:8</span></p>
<h3>3. Was it the gospel of Messiah that was preached unto Abraham ?</h3>
<p><q>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day:and he saw it,and was glad </q><span class="verse">John 8:56</span></p>
<h3>4. At what other time is it said the gospel was taught in the Old Testament dispensation ?</h3>
<p><q>For unto us was the gospel preached,as wellas unto them;but the word preached did not profit them,not being mixed with faith in them that heard it,</q><span class="verse">Hebrews 4:2</span></p>
<p class="NOTE">NOTE:The persons here referred to by them are the Israelites when on their journey from Egypt to the promised Land,as will be seen by the Scripture connection.Paul says the gospel was preached unto us as well as unto them,putting them ahead and letting us have the gospel afterward</p>
<h3>5. Why did Moses give up the riches of Egypt ?</h3>
<p><q>Esteeming the reproach of Messiah greater riches than the treasures in Egypt </q><span class="verse">Hebrews 11:26</span><br>
	People in that age,even as now,were influenced by the riches of Messiah to give up the world

</p>
<h3>6. Whence came the spiritual meat and drink of the Israelites while in the wilderness ?</h3>
<p><q>And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud  and in the sea;and did all eat the same spiritual meat;and did all drink the same spirtual drink;for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them:and that Rock was Messiah</q><span class="verse">1 Corinthians 10:2-4</span></p>
<h3>7. What was the chief cornerstone of the faith of both apostles and prophets ? </h3>
<p><q>And are build upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,Messiah Himself being the chief cornerstone</q><span class="verse">Ephesians 2:20</span></p>
<h3>8. What part of the scriptures did Philip hear a certain eunuch reading ?</h3>
<p><q>And Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah's and said,Understandest thou what thou readest ?</q><span class="verse">Acts 8:30</span></p>
<h3>9. When asked if he understood what he was reading,what reply did the eunuch make ?</h3>
<p><q>And he said,How can I,except some man should guide me ?And he desired Philiphat he would come up and sit with him</q><span class="verse">verse 31</span></p>
<h3>10. What did Philip then do ?</h3>
<p><q>Then Philip opened his mouth,and began at the same scripture,and preached unto him Messiah</q><span class="verse">verse 35</span></p>
<h3>11. What are the Scriptures able to do ?</h3>
<p><q>Thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Messiah</q><span>2 Timothy 3:15</span></p>
<h3>12. What was said of Berans because they searcheed the Scriptures daily ?</h3>
<p><q>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica,in that they received the word with all readiness of mind,and searched the Scriptures daily,whether those things were so</q><span class="verse">Act 17:11</span></p>
<h3>13. By what is Man to live ?</h3>
<p><q>Man shall not live by bread alone,but by every word that proceeeth out of the mouth of God,</q><span class="verse">Matthew 4:4</span><br>
	<p class="NOTE">NOTE:If Man is to live by the word of God,he certainly ought to use it daily,as daily nourishment is needed to keep him alive</p>
</p>
<h3>14. How greatly has God magnified His word ?</h3>
<p><q>I will worship toward Thy holy temple,and praise Thy name for Thy name for Thy loving kindenss and for Thy truth;for Thou hast magnified Thy word above all Thy name,</q><span class="verse">Plasm 138:2</span></p>

	Word of the everlasting God;
	Will of His glorious Son,
	Without Thee how could earth be trod,
	Or heaven itself be won?

	Lord,grant us all aright to learn
	The wisdom it imparts,
	And to its heavenly teaching turn 
	With simple,childlike hearts.
