	<h4>Peace on Earth.</h4>
	<pre>
		When Messiah was born in a manger
		God's anfels came down to this earth,
		And told to the lowly shepherds 
		The news of His wonderful birth.

		Oh,quickly they hastened to find Him 
		Their Savior,Redeemer and king;
		<q>Peace,peace upon earth</q>was the message 
		The angels did joyfully sing.

		They found Him at last,in the manger,
		Just as the angels had said,
		The dear little Bade His mother,
		And only the hay for a bed.
