<h3>Keytake aways</h3>
<p>The Millennium in the bible is the 1000 years that Yahshuah the son of the God of Israel shall rule the earth from Jerusalem the holy city of the lord.Those who will be found in this holy city will be those who keep his commands and testify of Yahshuah.Everybody who will be out of this city will be burnt to death.Yahshuah is the name above all name since it means God the saviour.In the name of Yahshuah  a lame man at the beautiful gate was healed,<span class="verse">{Acts 3:1-10}</span>.In the Hebrew bible you cannot find the name Jesus christ.This name Jesus christ was introduced in the bible during the transilation of the bible.In you dairly prayers use the name of Yahshuah not Jesus christ. </p>
