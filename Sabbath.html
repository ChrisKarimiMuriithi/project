	<h1>THE SABBATH</h1>
	
			<h3>Which day of the week is the Sabbath day?</h3>
	<p><q>But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God</q> <br><span class="verse">Exodus 20:10</span>
 </p>
 <h3>When does this day commence and at what time does it close</h3>
 <p><q>From even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath</q><span class="verse">leviticus 23:32,last part of the verse</span></p>
 <h3>For how long did God say they should keep the sabbath?</h3> 
 <p><q>Wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath,to observe the sabbath throughout their generations,for a perpetual convenant</q><span class="verse">Exodus 31:16</span></p>
 <h3>What does Messiah say of the sabbath?</h3>
 <p><q>And he said unto them,the sabbath was made for man,and not man for the sabbath</q><span class="verse">Mark 2:27</span></p>
 <h3>What distinguishes the seventh day of the week from the six working days</h3>
 <p><q>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made</q><span class="verse">Genesis 2:2</span></p>
 <h3>Besides resting on the seventh day,what did God pronounce upon it?</h3>
 <p><q>And God blessed the seventh day,and sanctified it </q>Genesis 2:3,firsth part of the verse</p>
 <h3>Why did God bless and sanctify this day?</h3>
 <p><q>Because that in it he rested from all his work which God created and made</q><span class="verse">Genesis 2:3 latter part of verse.</span></p>
 <p class="note">The sabbath was a part of creation,by God himself blessing,sanctifying,and resting upon this particular day,and it stands as a memorial of the great creative work of the first week of time.The only way to change the sabbath day,is for the creation to be gone through again,and it is not likely that such will ever be the case, </p>
 <h3>Is it possible for anything to be added to, or for anything to be taken from what God has done?</h3>
 <p><q>I know that,whatsoever God doeth,it shall be for ever:nothing can be put to it,noranything taken from it:and God doeth it,that men should fear before him</q><span class="verse">Ecclesiastes 3:14</span> </p>
 <h3>Have we any record where the sabbath was eer kept prior to the giving of the law on sinai</h3>
 <p><q>And Moses said,Eat that to day;for to day is a sabbath unto the lord:to day ue shall not find it in the field.Six days ye shall gather it;but on the seventh day,which is the sabbath,in it there shall be none.See for that on the sixth day the lord hath(in the past) given you the sabbay,therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days,...let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</q></p>
 <p class="note">These things happened several days prior to the giving of the law on sinai,and it is a fact that cannot be denied,for the simple reason, that these word are words of inspiration from God.</p>
 <h3>What law did God give for its observance?</h3>
 <p><q>Remeber the sabbath day,to keep it holy.Six days shalt thou labour,and do all thy work:But the seventh day is the sabbath of thelord thy God:in it thou shalt not do any work,thou,nor thy son,nor thy daughter,thy manservant,nor thy maid servant nor thy cattle,nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:for in six days the lord made heaven and earth,the sea and all that in them is,and rested the seventh day:wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath,and hallowed it. </q><span class="verse">Exodus 20:8-11</span></p>
 <h3>What statementis made herein,which has never been made of any other day?</h3>
 <p><q>But the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy God</q><span class="verse">Exodus 20:10</span></p>
 <h3>In what way did the lord require the sabbath to be kept?</h3>
 <p><q>Thus saith the lord:Take heed to yourselves,and bear no burden on the sabbath day,nor bring it in the gates of Jerusalem;neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day,neither do ye any work,but hallow ye the sabbath day,as i cammanded your fathers</q><span class="verse">Isaiah 58:13</span></p>
 <h3>How does Isaiah tell us to keep the sabbath?</h3>
 <p><q>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath,from doing thy pleasure on my holy day;and call the sabbath a delight,the holy of the lord,honourable;and shalt honour him,not doing thine own ways,nor finding thine own pleasure,nor speaking thine own words</q><span class="verse">Isaiah 58:13</span></p>
 <h3>What is said of the person that keeps the sabbath?</h3>
 <p><q>Blessed is the man that doeth this,and the son of man of man that layeth hold on it;that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,and keepeth his hand from doing any evil</q><span class="verse">Isaiah 56:2</span></p>
 <h3>What is said of the Gentiles that keep the sabbath?</h3>
 <p><q>Also the sons of the stranger,that join themselves to the lord,to serve him,and to love the name of the lord,to be his servants,every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,and taketh hold of my covenant;Even them will i bring to my holy mountain,and made them joyful in my house of prayer</q><span class="verse">Isaiah 56:6,7</span></p>
 <h3>What did the lord say the sabbath would be between him and his People?</h3>
 <p><q>I am the lord your God;walk in my statutes,and keep my judgments,and do them;and hallow my sabbaths;and they shall be a sign between me and you,that ye may know that i am the lord your God</q><span class="verse">Ezekiel 20:19,20</span></p>
 <h3>Did the Messiah observe the sabbath day in his life time?</h3>
 <p><q>And he came to Nazareth,where he had been brought up:and,as his <strong>custom was</strong>he went into he synagogue on the sabbath day,and stood up for to read.</q><span class="verse">Luke 4:16</span></p> 
 <p class="note">The Messiah hallowed the same sabbath that the Jews hallowed.Not any other day but the sabbath(saturday)</p>

 <p><q>Then spake Messiah again unto them,saying,i am the light of the world:he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life</q><span class="verse">John 8:12</span></p>
 <h3>What work is permissible on the sabbath?</h3>
 <p><q>And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.And,behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years,and was bowed together,and could in no wise lift up herself.And when Messiah saw her he called her to him,and said unto her,Woman,thou art loosed from thine infirmity.And he laid his hands on her:and immediately she was made  straight,and glorified God</q><span class="verse">Luke 13:10-13</span></p>
