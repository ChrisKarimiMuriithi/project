<h1 id="top" text-align: center;>LOVE</h1>
 
     <h2 class="loving" 
     >What is love </h2>

    	<P class="joy">The God of Israel describes love as being patient  and kind. Elohim also describes love as one that is not jeolous,proud,selfish or irritable.Elohim says that love does not keep a record of wrong;love is not happy with evil but is happy with the truth.love never gives up and its faith,hope,and patience never fails.This is writen in <span class="verse">{1Corithians13:4}</span>. </P>
        <img src="img/home page.jpg" alt="The word love written down " width="500">

    	<h2 class="hope">How important is love </h2>

        <p>Paul a servant of the creator of the universe says<q>"I may be able to speak the languages of human beings and even of angles,but if i have no love,my speech is no more than noisy gong or clanging bell.I may have  the gift of inspired preaching;I may have all knowledge and all secrets;I may have all faith needed to move mountain,but if i have no love , i am nothing.<mark>I may give away everything  i have and even give up my body to be burnt,</mark> if i have no love this does me no good</q>.<span class="verse">{1 Corithians13:1}</span>"Paul recorgnises that even if he has all the needed things in life, without love it's all waste. Paul still went on to say that love is the greatest compared to faith and hope</p>

        <h2 class="peace">Is it important for me to love others</h2>

        <p>John an apostle of lord Messiah says<q><span>If a man says, i love Elohim,and hateth his brother he is a liar:For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,how can love Elohim whom he hath not seen.<span class="verse">{1 John 4:20}</span>.</q> John explains that for you to love Elohim,you first have to love you brother and sister how you can see.John continous to say<q>That he who loveth Elohim love his brother also.<span class="verse">{1 John 4:21}</span>.</q> So it's impossible to love Elohim without first loving you brother.</p>

        <h2 class="patience">How does Elohim(God of Israel) know that we love him </h2>

        <p class="kindness">John an apostle of lord Messiah says<q>For this is the love of Elohim that we keep his commandment;and his commandment are not grievous.</q><span class="verse">{1 John 5:3} </span>. John says that whoever love the lord should keep his commandment.Messiah the son of the most high says<q>If ye love me keep my commandement.</q><span class="verse"> {John 14:15}</span>.Messiah is the son of the most high God, the one setted at the light side of the Father. He is telling us if we love him we should keep his commandement that he taught in his life time. He taught all about love for one another.<br>
          Obedience is so important that the Messiah says"My Mother and my Brothers are those how hear the word of Elohim(God) and <strong>do it</strong> If one obeys the word of the most high he or she becames a brother or sister to the Messiah . How wounderfull it is to be the brother or sister to the son of the most high .Think of how much you will enjoy just being a sibling to the Messiah how is coming as a King in his second coming.The only price you pay to be a sibling to MESSIAH the son of God is just loving . Does that sound like a hard thing to do?</p>

        <h2>What are the benefit one enjoys from just obeying Elohim commandment of loving</h2>
        
        <p>There are so many benefit that comes along with just obeying the most high.God has not just told us to keep his command,he has also promised great thing to us if we obey him.
        	<ol>
        	<li> A long  wonderfull life here on earth.<span class="verse">{Ephesians 6:1-4}</span><q>(Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.read more.)</q> This is one of the best promise that Elohim  has made to every one how obeys and honours his father and mother here on earth.Helping you Dad and telling you mum that you love her is a great step to earning  yourself long life.With just obeying and honouring your parent, you will get long life and also it shall be well with you. Some of our  life's  are a total disaster since we ignored our parents who are nothing but a blessing to use despite there personality. </li>
        	<li>Answers to prayers.This is also a very great promise that Elohim make to all those how obey him.<span class="verse"> {1 John3:22}</span> says<q>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him , because we keep his commandements, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight</q>.Through obeying the commandment of Elohim,our prayers get answered.Imagine living a life were everything you ask for in prayers, you receive it.No need to keep living in the word of fantacy,you already know the secreat to living that live.What a great reward! </li>
        	<li>Great peace.Those how obey the word of Elohim have a promise of peace in all situation.<span class="verse">{Plasms 119:165}</span> says<q>(Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.)</q>Ever being in great challanges that made you lack peace? No need to worry any more for if you obey Elohim commandment,you will have peace even in the midst of the storms</li>

        	</ol>
        </p> 

        <h2>How should we love each other</h2>
        
        <p>Elohim also called the God of love has shown as how we should love.This is by deeds and in truth not by words and tongue.<span class="verse">{1 John 3:18}</span><q>(My little children,let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth.)</q>So,If one love a person,he or she should not love by words and tongue but also by deeds.An example of love that has deeds:I am walking down the streats of a city called Nairobi and i find a hungry boy. As a follow of the lord i should at least give him what i can afford to give him. Instead of me telling him <q>Sorry,Dont worry GOD will provide</q>.<q>Elohim say in.<span class="verse">{James 2:26} </span>"Faith without action is dead.</q></p>

        <h2>Is it bad to be angry at my friends or hate them ?</h2>

        <p>Yes it is.Want to know why? The MESSIAH says in<span class="verse">{Mattew 5:22}</span><q>But i say unto you that whasoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement:and whoever says to his brother'you good for nothing 'shall be in danger of the council:but whoever shall say'Thou fool 'shall be in danger of hell fire'</q>You have heard it for yourself how bad it is to be angry and hate you friends.The only way to escape the judgement and hell fire is just loving  your neighbours as you love yourself.</p>

        <h2>What does it take to walk in the light and live in it?</h2>	

        <p>It's just love and nothing but love.In the book of<span class="verse"> {1 John 2:9-10} </span>Elohim says <q>He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother,is in the darkness even until now . He that loveth his brother abideth in the light,and there is none occassion of stumbling in him</q>For those how want to live in Gospel light must love there neighbours.Love is the foundation of all.I believe love is the strongest force in the universe.Do you?</p>

        <h2>Did MESSIAH love Elohim his father?</h2>

        <p>Yes he did. Messiah loved his father and obeyed him to the point of death.In the book of <span class="verse">{John 14:31}</span>,he confesses this by saying <q>But that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment,even so i do.</q>From this confession we can see that out of his love for his father,he obeyed every thing he had been told to do.His work was to teach us and die for our sins.</p>

        <h2>How can i love when i dont have love in me?</h2>

        <P>Wondering were you can get your heart filled with this love?I know of a place were love is neither sold nor denied,and that is in Messiah the son of the God of love.In the book of<span class="verse"> {Mattew7:7}</span> Messiah says<q>Ask, and it shall be given to you;seek,and ye shall find;knock,and it shall be opened unto you</q>You can only access the fruit of love through asking it in prayers for nothing is impossible with Elohim.</P>
