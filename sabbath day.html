	<h1>Which day is the sabbath of the New testament?</h1>
	<p>Which day did Yahshuah and the apostles observe?Which day did paul teach Gentile converts to observe?HOW did the day become changed from the seventh to the first day of the week?</p>
	<p>We have been reared in a Sunday-observing world.Naturally,we have taken Sunday-observance for granted.Naturally,the idea of a different day as the true Sabbath-day strikes us as fanatical and absurd.</p>
	<p>Yet today some are telling us SATURDAY is the right day.They insist the SEVENTH day is the only day the Bible anywhere commands us to keep.They even claim we are sinning --that we have the <span class="mark">Mark of the Beast</span>and shall suffer the seven last plagues--if we observe Sunday instead of keeping the seventh day</p>
	<h2>Many False prophets</h2>
	<p>The Messiah warned that many false prophets would appear,deceiving many.So what is the TRUTH?How can we KNOW?</p>
	<p>Let all remember each of us shall stand before the judgement-seat.We shall be JUDGED,not by our sincerity in what we have always believed thru careless assumption,nor by our sincerity in following some NEW teaching without proof!We shall be judged by the BIBLE,God's Word!</p>
	<h2>How to PROVE the truth</h2> 
	<p><q>All scripture is given by inspiration of God,and is profitable for doctrine,for reproof,for correction.</q><span class="verse">2 Timothy 3:16</span>Again,the command to us is <q>PROVE ALL THINGS</q></p> 
	<p>We must be able and wiling to study BOTH sides honestly,laying our ideas and desires on the shelf,prayerfully asking God for guidance </p>
	<p>If we already are right,honest investigation will but confirm it.</p>
	<p>If we are WRONG,we should want to know it.And we shall quickly,willingly as a little child accept the TRUTH as God reveals it,whatever that truth may be if our hearts are right with him!Perhaps this very study may be the TEST!</p>
	<p>On the following pages is a brief,terse outline of ONE PHASE of this many-side question.Explanation of other phases,answering other questions that may come up,will be supplied on request.</p>
	<h3>These three facts are self-evident.</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Sunday is the first day of the week.See any calender,dictonary,or encyclopedia.Is it,then,by BIBLE authority,<q>the christian sabbath,</q>or truly the <q>lord's Day,</q>as it is popularly called today?</li>
		<li>The Messiah kept the SABBATH,<span class="verse">Luke 4:16</span>It was his custom.The Sabbath He kept was the same day  of the week the Jews observed,for the minister and continually rebuked Messiah for healing on the Sabbath day</li>
		<li>The Sabbath Messiah kept was the seventh day of the week.Three days after His crucifixion,this sabbath still was the day before the first day of the week,<span class="verse">Matthew 28:1</span>Therefore if was not just any day in seven,it was seventh day of the week.See also <span class="verse">Luke 23:56,24:1</span></li>
	</ol>
	<p>BUT...was the day CHANGED,by christ or the apostles,after this,to the first day of the week so that Sunday is now the New Testament Christian Sabbath?Does the NEW TESTAMENT someplace,show us that is the true lord's day and command christians to observe it? <a href="Sabbath.html">LET US SEE?</a></p>
